Follow the steps below to delete a cluster using the PKS CLI.

1. On the command line, run `pks login -a PKS_API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD` to log in. Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:
  * `PKS_API` is your PKS API hostname. For example, `pks.example.com`. The PKS CLI uses port 9021 by default.
  * `USERNAME` is your PKS API username. The `USERNAME` is the user created as a result of the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ step in the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.
  * `PASSWORD` is your PKS API password. The `PASSWORD` can be retrieved by following the steps detailed in the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ section of the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.

1. Run `pks delete-cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to delete a cluster. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks delete-cluster my-cluster</pre>
