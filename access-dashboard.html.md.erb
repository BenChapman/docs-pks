The Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot containerized applications, and manage the cluster and its resources. Dashboard also provides information about the state of Kubernetes resources in the cluster. You can use Dashboard to manage the cluster at scale, including initiating rolling updates, restarting pods, and deploying new applications. 

For more information about Dashboard, see the Kubernetes [Web UI (Dashboard)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

You must have `kubectl` credentials to access Dashboard. Requiring these credentials prevents unauthorized admin access to the Kubernetes cluster through a browser.

## Accessing the Dashboard

To access the dashboard, follow the steps in [Accessing the Dashboard UI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/#accessing-the-dashboard-ui) in the Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard) documentation.
