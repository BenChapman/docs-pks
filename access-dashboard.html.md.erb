title: Access the Dashboard
owner: PKS

 The Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use the Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot containerized applications, and manage the cluster and its resources. The Dashboard also provides information about the state of Kubernetes resources in the cluster.

You must have `kubectl` credentials to access the Dashboard. This requirement prevents unauthorized admin access to the Kubernetes cluster through a browser.

Follow the steps below to access the Dashboard for a Kubernetes cluster.

1. As a PKS operator or developer, you may already have access to `kubectl` credentials.
If you do not, follow the instructions in [Retrieve Cluster Credentials and Configuration](cluster-credentials.html).

1. After retrieving `kubectl` credentials, run `kubectl proxy` on a command line. Do not exit or close the terminal.

1. In a web browser, browse to `http://localhost:8001/ui` to access the Dashboard.
