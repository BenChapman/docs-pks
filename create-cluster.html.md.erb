title: Create a Cluster
owner: PKS
---

Follow the steps below to create a Kubernetes cluster using the PKS CLI.

1. Locate the external hostname for accessing the Kubernetes API.
Use one of the following methods, depending on your PKS installation:
  * If your PKS installation is **integrated with NSX-T**, use the NAT IP from the `ip-pool-vips` NSX IP pool.
  For more information, see [Enable NAT Access](installing-nsx-t.html#nsxt-master-nat) in <em>Installing and Configuring PKS with NSX-T Integration</em>.
  * If your PKS installation is **not integrated with NSX-T**, [create an external load balancer](deploy-workloads.html#external-lb) and record its IP address or hostname.
  Each new cluster requires its own TCP or HTTPS load balancer to allow external access.
  When you provide the external hostname later in this procedure, you can either use the load balancer IP address or a hostname from the domain you specified for the PKS API.
  For more information, see the PKS API section of <em>Installing and Configuring PKS on [GCP](installing-pks-gcp.html#pks-api) or [vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#pks-api)</em>.

1. Grant cluster access to a new or existing user in UAA.
See the [Grant Cluster Access to a User](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) section of _Manage Users in UAA_ for more information.

1. Run the following command to create a cluster:
  <pre>
  pks create-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --external-hostname HOSTNAME --plan PLAN-NAME [--num-nodes WORKER-NODES]
  </pre>
  Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:
  * `CLUSTER-NAME` is a unique name for your cluster.
  * `HOSTNAME` is the external hostname for accessing the Kubernetes API. Use the hostname you located earlier in this procedure.
  * `PLAN-NAME` is the name of the plan you want to use to create the cluster.
  * `WORKER-NODES` is the number of worker nodes for the cluster.  For high availability, Pivotal recommends creating clusters with at least 3 worker nodes. The maximum value is 50. This flag is optional.

  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks create-cluster my-cluster --external-hostname 10.0.0.1 --plan large --num-nodes 3</pre>

1. Track the cluster creation process by running `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME`.
Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks cluster my-cluster</pre>
  The cluster status appears in the **Last Action State** column.
  If the last action state is `error`, troubleshoot cluster creation by logging in to the BOSH Director and running `bosh tasks`.
  See [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html) for more information.

1. When cluster creation is complete, configure the external hostname.
  1. Run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME`to view cluster details. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks cluster my-cluster</pre>
  1. Locate the master IP address for the cluster in the `kubernetes_master_ips` row.
  1. Configure your external TCP or HTTPS load balancer to point to the master IP address, including the UAA port number. For example, `https://192.168.20.1:8443`.

1. To access your cluster, run `pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME`.
This command creates a local `kubeconfig` that allows you to manage the cluster.
See [Retrieve Cluster Credentials and Configuration](cluster-credentials.html) for more information.

1. Run `kubectl cluster-info` to confirm you can access your cluster using the Kubernetes CLI.

See [Managing PKS](managing.html) for information about checking cluster health and viewing cluster logs.
