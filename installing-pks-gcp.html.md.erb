This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Before performing the procedures in this topic, consult the [GCP Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](gcp-requirements.html) topic.

##<a id='loadbalancer-pks-api'></a> Step 1: Configure External Load Balancer

Configure an external TCP load balancer to resolve to the domain name you use to access the PKS API.

### <a id=‘create-lb’></a> Create a Load Balancer for the PKS API

1. In a browser, navigate to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

1. Navigate to **Network Services > Load balancing** and click **Create load balancer**.

1. Under **TCP Load Balancing**, click **Start configuration**.

1. Select whether you want to load balance traffic from the Internet to your VMs or only between your VMs.

1. Select whether you want to place the backends for your load balancer in a single region or across multiple regions.

1. Give your load balancer a name. Pivotal recommends naming your load balancer `pks-api`.

1. Select **Backend configuration**.
   * Select a region.
   * Select a network.
   * Select backends from either instance groups or VM instances in the target pool's region.
   * (Optional) Select a backup pool.
   * (Optional) Select whether you want to create a health check or go without one.
   * Select a session affinity. **None** will enable successive requests from a particular client IP to go to any instance in the pool. **Client IP** will send requests from the client IP to the same instance. **Client IP and protocol** will send requests from the client IP with the same protocol to the same instance.
   * (Optional) Select **Advanced configurations** to configure the **Connection draining timeout**.

1. Select **Frontend configuration**.
   * (Optional) Give your frontend a name. For example, `pks-api-ip`.
   * (Optional) Give your frontend a description.
   * Select **Create IP address** to reserve an IP address for the PKS API endpoint.
   * Under **Ports**, enter 8443 and 9021. Your external load balancer forwards traffic to the UAA endpoint on port 8443 and the PKS API endpoint on port 9021.
   * Click **Done**.

1. Click **Review and finalize** to review your load balancer configuration.

1. Click **Create**.

### <a id='firewall-rule'></a> Create a Firewall Rule for the Load Balancer

1. From the GCP console, navigate to **VPC Network > Firewall rules** and click **Create firewall rule**.

1.  Configure the following:
   * Give your firewall rule a name.
   * Select the network to which the firewall rule will apply.
   * Specify the priority of this firewall rule.
   * Select **Ingress** as the **Direction of traffic**.
   * Select **Allow** as the **Action on match**.
   * Select the load balancer you just created as your target.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that the PKS VM hosting the PKS API and Broker has the `pks-api` network tag. If it does not have the `pks-api` tag, add it so the above firewall rule will apply to it.</p>
   * Use `0.0.0.0/0` as your source IP range.
   * Under **Protocols and ports**, select **Specified protocols and ports** and specify `tcp:8443,9021`.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id='wildcard-dns-entry'></a> Create a Wildcard DNS Entry for the Load Balancer

To create a wildcard DNS entry in GCP for your PKS API domain, do the following:

1. From the GCP console, navigate to **Network Services > Cloud DNS**.

1. If you do not already have a DNS zone, click **Create zone**.
   * Give a zone name and a DNS name.
   * Specify whether the **DNSSEC** state of the zone is Off, On, or Transfer.
   * Click **Create**.

1. Click **Add Record Set**.

1. Under **DNS Name**, enter a subdomain for the load balancer. For example, to use `pks-api.pks.example.com` as your PKS API hostname, enter `pks-api` in this field.

1. Select a **Resource Record Type**, **TTL**, and **TTL Unit**.

1. Enter the load balancer IP address.

1. Click **Create**.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install PKS

To install PKS, do the following:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
1. Navigate to `https://YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/` in a browser to log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. From the **Director Config** page, configure the following settings:
  * Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts**.
  * Clear the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.
1. Click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.
1. Under **Pivotal Container Service** in the left column, click the plus sign to add this product to your staging area.

###<a id='azs-networks'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Select an availability zone (AZ) for your singleton jobs and one or more AZs to balance other jobs in.

    ![Assign AZs and Networks pane in Ops Manager](images/azs-networks.png)

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you upgrade PKS, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the PKS tile.
  You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In PKS, Pivotal Container Service is a singleton job. This broker VM enables the creation of PKS clusters through the PKS CLI.</p>
1. Under **Network**, select a subnet for the PKS broker.
1. Under **Service Network**, select a subnet for the on-demand service instances created by the PKS broker.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='pks-api'></a> PKS API

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **PKS API**.
1. Under **Certificate to secure the PKS API**, provide your own wildcard certificate and private key pair.
The certificate you enter here should cover the domain that routes to the PKS broker VM with TLS termination on the ingress.<br><br>
    (Optional) If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can have Ops Manager generate one for you. Perform the following steps:
  1. Select the **Generate RSA Certificate** link.
  1. Enter the wildcard domain for your API hostname.
    For example, if your PKS API domain is `api.pks.example.com`, then enter `*.pks.example.com`.
  1. Click **Generate**.
1. Under **API Hostname (FQDN)**, enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to access the PKS API.
For example, `api.pks.example.com`.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='plans'></a> Plans

To activate a plan, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A plan defines a set of resource types used for deploying clusters. You can configure up to three plans. Configuring **Plan 1** is required.
  </p>
1. Select **Active** to activate the plan and make it available to developers deploying clusters.
1. Under **Name**, provide a unique name for the plan.
1. Under **Description**, edit the description as needed.
The plan description appears in the Services Marketplace, which developers can access by using PKS CLI.
1. Under **AZ placement**, select an AZ for the Kubernetes clusters deployed by PKS.
1. Under **Default Cluster Authorization Mode**, select an authentication mode for the Kubernetes clusters. Pivotal recommends selecting **RBAC**. For more information, see the [RBAC Support in Kubernetes](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/04/rbac-support-in-kubernetes.html) blog post.

1. Under **Master Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes master VM.
1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Node Instances**, select the default number of Kubernetes worker nodes to provision for each cluster. For high availability, Pivotal recommends creating clusters with at least 3 worker nodes.
1. Under **Errand VM Type**, select the size of the VM where the errand will run. The smallest instance possible is sufficient, as the only errand running on this VM is the one that applies the **Default Cluster App** YAML configuration.
1. (Optional) Under **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution**, enter additional YAML configuration to [add custom workloads](custom-workloads.html) to each cluster in this plan. You can specify multiple files using `---` as a separator.
1. If you want users to be able to create [pods with privileged containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#privileged-mode-for-pod-containers), select the **Enable Privileged Containers - Use with caution** option.
1. Click **Save**.

To deactivate a plan, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
1. Select **Plan Inactive**.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

To configure your Kubernetes cloud provider settings, do the following:

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.
1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select **GCP**.
1. Perform the steps specific to GCP.
	* Ensure the values match those in the **Google Config** section of the **Ops Manager** tile:
		1. Enter your **GCP Project Id**, which is the name of the  deployment in your Ops Manager environment. 
		1. Enter your **VPC Network**, which is the VPC network name for your Ops Manager environment.
		1. Enter your **GCP Service Key**, which you created using [the instructions from the GCP prerequisites](gcp-requirements.html).
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Flannel**.
1. (Optional) Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled** to configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters.
  ![Enable HTTP/HTTPS Proxy configuration](images/https-proxy.png)
  1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.
  1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password in either **HTTP Proxy Credentials** or **HTTPS Proxy Credentials**.
  1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the `.internal`, `10.100.0.0/8`, and `10.200.0.0/8` IP ranges are not proxied. This is to allow internal PKS communication.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='uaa'></a> UAA

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **UAA**.
1. Under **PKS CLI Access Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI access token lifetime.
1. Under **PKS CLI Refresh Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI refresh token lifetime.

###<a id='syslog'></a> (Optional) Syslog

You can designate an external syslog endpoint for PKS component and cluster log messages.

To specify the destination for PKS log messages, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Syslog**.
1. Select **Yes** to configure syslog forwarding.
1. Enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Enter the destination syslog port.
1. Select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. (Optional) Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption when forwarding logs as they may contain sensitive information. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. To enable TLS, perform the following steps.
  1. Provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.</p>

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation. 

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand. For a typical PKS deployment, Pivotal recommends that you leave the default settings.

For more information about errands and their configuration state, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

1. To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **PKS on-demand broker** job.

1. Enter a name for your PKS API load balancer that begins with `tcp:` in the **Load Balancers** column.
For example, `tcp:pks-api`.
For more information, see [Step 1: Configure External Load Balancer](#loadbalancer-pks-api).

###<a id='stemcell'></a> (Optional) Stemcell

To edit the stemcell configuration, click **Stemcell**. Click **Import Stemcell** to import a new stemcell. 

PKS uses floating stemcells. Floating stemcells allow upgrades to the minor versions of stemcells but not the major versions. 
For example, a stemcell can float from `1234.56` to `1234.99` but not from `1234.991` to `1235.0`. 
For more information on floating stemcells, see the 
[Understanding Floating Stemcells](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html) topic.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <b>Upgrade all clusters errand</b>. Pivotal recommends that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.</p>

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 4: Apply Changes

After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint

You must share the PKS API endpoint to allow your organization to use the API to create, update, and delete clusters.

When an operator creates a cluster, they provide an IP address for the Kubernetes master host, then point the load balancer to the newly created cluster.
If you use a load balancer as a service (LBaaS) tool, your LBaaS may manage cluster creation and configuration.

See [Using PKS](create-cluster.html) for more information.

Perform the following steps to retrieve the PKS API endpoint:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click the Pivotal Container Service tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab and locate the IP address of the PKS API endpoint. This is the endpoint that developers use to create and manage clusters.
