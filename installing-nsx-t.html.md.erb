<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The PKS documentation is under development. This topic will continue to be updated and expanded to reflect the most current information.</p>

This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

Before performing the procedures in this topic, consult the requirements in the [vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When using NSX-T, namespaces for pods can be no longer than 40 characters.</p>

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

The following diagram details the architecture of a NSX-T with PKS Network Address Translation (NAT) deployment described in this topic.

![NSX & PKS Overview](images/nsx-t-overview.png)

Click [here](https://docs-pks.cfapps.io/pks/images/nsx-t-overview.png) to view a larger version of this image.

This NAT topology as depicted in the image above has the following characteristics:

* The BOSH Director, Ops Manager, and the PKS service instance are all located on a logical switch NAT'd behind a T1.
* All Kubernetes cluster nodes are located on a logical switch NAT'd behind a T1. This will require NAT rules to allow access to Kubernetes APIs.

##<a id='config-network'></a> Step 1: Configure Network

Refer to the [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html) to create and assign the following network CIDRs in the IPv4 address space and ensure they are routable in your environment:

* **VTEP CIDR(s)**: This network(s) will host your GENEVE Tunnel Endpoints on your NSX Transport Nodes. Size the network(s) to support all of your expected Host and Edge Transport Nodes. For example, a CIDR of `192.168.1.0/24` will provide 254 usable IPs.   It will be leveraged when creating the `ip-pool-vteps` in a later step.
* **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**: This small network will be used for NAT access to PKS management components like Ops Manager and the PKS Service VM. For example, a CIDR of `10.172.1.0/28` will provide 14 usable IPs.
* **PKS LB CIDR**: This network will provide your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by PKS. The network will also provide IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services. For example, `10.172.2.0/25` will provide 126 usable IPs. This network will be used when creating the `ip-pool-vips` in [Create NSX Network Objects](#create-objects-network-objects) below.

You must also refer to the [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html) in order to provide or configure your network topology to enable the following:

* vCenter, NSX-T components, and ESXi hosts must be able to communicate with each other.
* The Ops Manager Director VM must be able to communicate with vCenter and the NSX-T Manager.
* The Ops Manager Director VM must be able to communicate with all nodes in all Kubernetes clusters.
* Each Kubernetes cluster deployed by PKS will deploy a NCP pod that must be able to communicate with the NSX-T Manager.

##<a id='deploy-nsx-t'></a> Step 2: Deploy NSX-T

Refer to the [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html) in order to deploy the following core NSX-T components:

1. [Deploy](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-A65FE3DD-C4F1-47EC-B952-DEDF1A3DD0CF.html) the NSX-T Manager.
1. [Deploy](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-447C0417-A37B-4C2E-965E-499F52587160.html) the NSX-T Controller(s).
1. [Join](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-05434745-7D74-4DA8-A68E-9FE17093DA7B.html) the NSX-T Control Cluster to the NSX-T Manager and [initialize](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-273F6344-7212-4105-9FBA-A872CD75803F.html) the NSX Controller Cluster.
1. Add your ESX host(s) to the NSX-T Fabric. Each host must have at least one free vmnic not already used by other vSwitches on the ESX host for use with NSX Host Transport Nodes.
1. [Deploy](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-11417AA2-5EBC-49C7-8A86-EB94604261A6.html) NSX Edge VMs. When deploying NSX Edge VMs, you must connect the vNICs of the NSX Edge VMs to an appropriate PortGroup for your environment by performing the following steps:
  1. Connect the first Edge interface to your environment's PortGroup/VLAN where your Edge Management IP can route and communicate with the NSX-T Manager.
  1. Connect the second Edge interface to your environment's PortGroup/VLAN where your T0 uplink interface will be located.  Your **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** and **PKS LB CIDR** should be routable to this PortGroup.
  1. Connect the third Edge interface to your environment's PortGroup/VLAN where your GENEVE VTEPs can route and communicate with each other. Your **VTEP CIDR** should be routable to this PortGroup.
  1. [Join](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-11BB4CF9-BC1D-4A76-A32A-AD4C98CBF25B.html) the NSX Edge VM(s) to the NSX-T Fabric.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Each NSX Edge VM deployed will require free resources in your vSphere Environment to provide 8 vCPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 120 GB of storage.</p>

##<a id='create-objects'></a> Step 3: Create Required NSX-T Objects for PKS

The following sections refer to topics in the [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html) to describe how to create the objects in the NSX-T deployment required for PKS. 

###<a id='create-objects-network-objects'></a> Create NSX Network Objects

1. [Create](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-E7F7322D-D09B-481A-BD56-F1270D7C9692.html) two NSX IP pools:
  * One NSX IP pool for GENEVE Tunnel Endpoints `ip-pool-vteps,` within the usable range of the **VTEP CIDR** created in the previous section
  * One NSX IP pool for NSX Load Balancing VIPs `ip-pool-vips,` within the usable range of the **PKS LB CIDR** created in the previous section
1. [Create](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-F739DC79-4358-49F4-9C58-812475F33A66.html) two NSX Transport Zones (TZs):
  * One NSX TZ for PKS control plane Services and Kubernetes Cluster deployment overlay network(s) called `tz-overlay` and the associated host switch `hs-overlay`
  * One NSX TZ for NSX Edge uplinks (ingress/egress) for PKS Kubernetes cluster(s) called `tz-vlan` and the associated host switch `hs-vlan`
1. If the default uplink profile is not applicable in your use case, [create](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-50FDFDFB-F660-4269-9503-39AE2BBA95B4.html) a NSX uplink host profile.
1. [Create](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-D7CA778B-6554-4A23-879D-4BC336E01031.html) NSX Host Transport Node(s) 
  * For each host in the NSX-T Fabric, create a node named `tnode-host-NUMBER`. For example, if you have three hosts in the NSX-T Fabric, create three nodes named `tnode-host-1`, `tnode-host-2`, and `tnode-host-3`.
  * Add the `tz-overlay` NSX Transport Zone to each NSX Host Transport Node.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Transport Nodes must be placed on free host NICs not already used by other vSwitches on the ESX host. Use the `ip-pool-vteps` IP pool that will allow them to route and communicate with each other as well as other Edge Transport Nodes to build GENEVE tunnels.</p>

1. [Create](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-46C7B20D-4BE4-400E-AF39-1ADFE945DE38.html) a NSX IP Block named `ip-block-pks-deployments`. The NSX-T Container Plug-in (NCP) and PKS will use this IP Block to assign address space to Kubernetes pods through the Container Networking Interface (CNI). Pivotal recommends using the CIDR block `172.16.0.0/16`.

   * Enable **Status**.
   * Enable **Advertise All NSX Connected Routes**.
   * Enable **Advertise All NAT Routes**.
   * Enable **Advertise All LB VIP Routes**.
1. Create a SNAT rule on the T1 to allow the PKS Management VMs to communicate with your vCenter and NSX Manager environments. For example, a SNAT rule that maps `172.31.0.0/24` to `10.172.1.1`, where `10.172.1.1` is a routable IP from your **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**. For more information, see [Configure Source NAT on a Tier-1 Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-31CEF010-0C34-4C10-9443-13A0EAAABFD6.html) in the VMware documentation.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Limit the Destination CIDR for the SNAT rules to the subnet(s) that contain your vCenter and NSX Manager IP addresses.</p>
1. Create a DNAT rule on the T1 to map an external IP from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the IP where you will deploy Ops Manager on the `ls-pks-mgmt` logical switch. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.2` to `172.31.0.2`, where `172.31.0.2` is the IP address you assign to Ops Manager when connected to `ls-pks-mgmt`. For more information, see [Configure Destination NAT on a Tier-1 Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-0B572AF0-8AAE-4C4E-83A6-A7DEF4CF5DCD.html) in the VMware documentation.

* [Configure](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-B6AF9E08-1334-4D3A-B8ED-D0CAB3B563FB.html) route advertisement on the T1 as follows:
   * Enable **Advertise All NSX Connected Routes**.
   * Enable **Advertise All NAT Routes**.
   * Enable **Advertise All LB VIP Routes**.
* [Create](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-31CEF010-0C34-4C10-9443-13A0EAAABFD6.html) a SNAT rule on the T1 to allow the Kubernetes Cluster VMs to communicate with your environment's NSX-T Manager and allow the NCP pod on each cluster to communicate with your NSX-T Manager. For example, a SNAT rule that maps `172.31.2.0/23` to `10.172.1.3`, where `10.172.1.3` is a routable IP from your **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Limit the Destination CIDR for the SNAT rules to the subnet(s) that contain your vCenter and NSX Manager IP addreses.</p>

##<a id='config-ops-man'></a> Step 4: Configure Ops Manager

Perform the following steps to configure Ops Manager for the NSX logical switches:

1. Navigate to `https://YOUR-OPSMAN-FQDN` in a browser to log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile.
1. Complete the procedures in [Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/vsphere-config.html).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have Pivotal Application Service (PAS) installed, Pivotal recommends installing PKS on a separate instance of Ops Manager v2.0.</p>
1. Verify the following Ops Manager settings:
    * Ensure that **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** on the **Director Config** page is enabled.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This setting enables post-deploy scripts for all tiles in your Ops Manager installation.</p>
    * Ensure that BOSH DNS is enabled. If you disabled BOSH DNS, you must re-enable it and redeploy PCF.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH DNS must be enabled in all PKS deployments. If PAS and PKS are running on the same instance of Ops Manager, you cannot use the opt-out feature of BOSH DNS for your PAS without breaking PKS. If you want to opt out of BOSH DNS in your PAS deployment, install the tile on a separate instance of Ops Manager. For more information about opting out of BOSH DNS, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015720428-Disabling-or-Opting-Out-of-BOSH-DNS-in-PCF">this KB article</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#bosh-dns">Ops Manager v2.0 Release Notes</a>.</p>
    * Ensure that **Standard vCenter Networking** is selected on the **vCenter Config** page. This configuration is utilized for PAS only. You configure NSX-T integration for PKS in a later step.
1. Click **Create Networks**.
1. Create the following two networks:
  * A network for deploying the PKS control plane VM(s) that maps to the NSX logical switch named `ls-pks-mgmt` created for the PKS Management Network in [Step 3: Create Required Objects](#create-objects)
  * A service network for deploying PKS Kubernetes cluster nodes that maps to the NSX logical switch named `ls-pks-service` created for the PKS Service Network in [Step 3: Create Required Objects](#create-objects)
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using this NAT topology, you must have already deployed Ops Manager to the <code>ls-pks-mgmt</code> NSX logical switch by following <a href="#create-objects">Step 3: Create Logical Router for PKS Management VMs</a> above. You will use the DNAT IP address to access Ops Manager.</p>

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 6: Apply Changes and Retrieve the PKS Endpoint

1. After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the PKS tile.
1. When the installation is completed, retrieve the PKS endpoint by performing the following steps:
  1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.
  1. Click the **Status** tab and record the IP address assigned to the `Pivotal Container Service` job.
1. Create a DNAT rule on the `t1-pks-mgmt` T1 to map an external IP from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the PKS endpoint. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.4` to `172.31.0.4`, where `172.31.0.4` is PKS endpoint IP address on the `ls-pks-mgmt` NSX Logical Switch. For more information, see [Configure Destination NAT on a Tier-1 Router]( https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-0B572AF0-8AAE-4C4E-83A6-A7DEF4CF5DCD.html) in the VMware documentation.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you have no overlapping NAT rules. If your NAT rules overlap, you cannot reach Ops Manager from VMs in the vCenter network.</p>

Developers should use the DNAT IP address when logging in with the PKS CLI. For more information, see [Using PKS](using.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: The PKS CLI is under active development and commands may change. To ensure you have installed the latest version, we recommend that you re-install the PKS CLI before you use it. To install the PKS CLI, see <a href="installing-pks-cli.html">Installing the PKS CLI</a>.</p>

##<a id='nsxt-master-nat'></a> Step 7: Deploy a Cluster and Enable NAT Access

In the current version of PKS, NSX-T does not automatically configure a NAT for the master node of each Kubernetes cluster. As a result, you must perform the following procedure for each cluster to enable your developers to use `kubectl`: 

1. Download the NSX scripts:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ wget https&#58;//storage.googleapis.com/pks-releases/nsx-helper-pkg.tar.gz
  </pre>
1. Untar the `nsx-helper-pkg.tar.gz` file:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ tar -xvzf nsx-helper-pkg.tar.gz
  </pre>
1. Install required packages:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ sudo apt-get install git
  $ sudo apt-get install -y httpie 
  </pre>
1. One of the files from the tarball is `nsx-cli.sh`. Make the script executable:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ chmod 755 nsx-cli.sh
  </pre>
1. Set your NSX Manager admin user, password, and IP address as environment variables named `NSX_MANAGER_USERNAME`, `NSX_MANAGER_PASSWORD`, and `NSX_MANAGER_IP`. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ export NSX&#95;MANAGER&#95;USERNAME="admin-user" 
  $ export NSX&#95;MANAGER&#95;PASSWORD="admin-password"
  $ export NSX&#95;MANAGER&#95;IP="192.0.2.1" 
  </pre>
1. Execute the `nsx-cli` script with the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ ./nsx-cli.sh ipam allocate
  </pre>
  Developers can use this IP address as the `--external-hostname` value to create a cluster via the PKS CLI. For more information, see [Using PKS](using.html).
1. Collect the Cluster UUID after cluster has been successfully created. 
   <pre class="terminal">
   $ pks clusters
   </pre>
1. Use the `nsx-cli` script to create a NAT rule to allow access to the Kubernetes API for the cluster. Execute the following command:
   <pre class="terminal">
   $ ./nsx-cli.sh nat create-rule CLUSTER-UUID MASTER-IP NAT-IP
   </pre>
    <br>
    Where:
    <br>
    * `CLUSTER-UUID` is the ID of the cluster retrieved in the previous step.
    * `MASTER-IP` is the IP address that BOSH has assigned to the master node of the cluster. To retrieve this value, use the [BOSH CLI v2](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html) to log in to your BOSH Director and list all instances with `bosh -e YOUR-ENV instances`.
    * `NAT-IP` is the NAT IP from the `ip-pool-vips` NSX IP pool retrieved above.

##<a id='nsxt-cleanup'></a> Step 8: Clean NSX-T Objects After Deletion of a Cluster

In the current version of PKS, NSX-T does not automatically delete NSX-T objects created during the life of the product.  After a cluster is deleted, you **must** perform the following task using the `nsx-cli.sh` script downloaded in [Step 7](installing-nsx-t.html#nsxt-master-nat):

1. [Delete](./using.html#delete-cluster) the Kubernetes Cluster using the PKS CLI. 

2. Execute the `nsx-cli` script with the following command:
   <pre class="terminal">
   $ ./nsx-cli.sh cleanup CLUSTER-UUID false
   </pre>
    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the ID of the cluster you deleted.
