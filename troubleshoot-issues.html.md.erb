## <a id="timeouts"></a>Cannot Access Add-On Features or Functions 

**Symptom**

You cannot access a feature or function provided by a Kubernetes add-on.

Examples include the following:  

- You cannot access the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) in a browser or using the kubectl command-line tool.
- [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster) does not start.
- Pods cannot resolve DNS names, and error messages report the service `kube-dns` is invalid. If `kube-dns` is not deployed, the cluster typically fails to start.

**Explanation**

The Kubernetes features and functions listed above are provided by the following PKS add-ons: 

* **Kubernetes Dashboard** `kubernetes-dashboard`
* **Heapster**: `heapster`
* **DNS Resolution**: `kube-dns`

To enable these add-ons, Ops Manager must run scripts after deploying PKS. You must configure Ops Manager to automatically run these post-deploy scripts.

**Solution**

Perform the following steps to configure Ops Manager to run post-deploy scripts to deploy the missing add-ons to your cluster.

1. Navigate to `https://YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/` in a browser to log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the Ops Manager v2.0 tile.

1. Select **Director Config**.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This setting enables post-deploy scripts for all tiles in your Ops Manager installation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. After Ops Manager finishes applying changes, enter `pks delete-cluster` on the command line to delete the cluster. For more information, see the [Delete Cluster](delete-cluster.html) section of _Using PKS_.

1. On the command line, enter `pks create-cluster` to recreate the cluster. For more information, see the [Create Cluster](create-cluster.html) section of the _Using PKS_.

##<a id='bosh-pks-map'></a>Error: Failed Jobs

**Symptom**

In stdout or log files, you see an error message referencing `post-start scripts failed` or `Failed Jobs`.

**Explanation**

After deploying PKS, Ops Manager runs scripts to start a number of jobs. You must configure Ops Manager to automatically run these post-deploy scripts.

**Solution**

Perform the following steps to configure Ops Manager to run post-deploy scripts. 

1. Navigate to `https://YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/` in a browser to log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the Ops Manager v2.0 tile.

1. Select **Director Config**.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This setting enables post-deploy scripts for all tiles in your Ops Manager installation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. After Ops Manager finishes applying changes, enter `pks delete-cluster` on the command line to delete the cluster. For more information, see the [Delete Cluster](delete-cluster.html) section of _Using PKS_.

1. On the command line, enter `pks create-cluster` to recreate the cluster. For more information, see the [Create Cluster](create-cluster.html) section of the _Using PKS_.

##<a id='no-such-host'></a>Error: No Such Host

**Symptom**

In stdout or log files, you see an error message that includes `lookup vm-WORKER-NODE-GUID on IP-ADDRESS: no such host`.

**Explanation**

This error occurs on GCP when the Ops Manager Director tile uses 8.8.8.8 as the DNS server.
When this IP range is in use, the master node cannot locate the route to the worker nodes.

**Solution**

Use the Google internal DNS range, 169.254.169.254, as the DNS server.

##<a id='storage'></a>Error: FailedMount

**Symptom**

In Kubernetes log files, you see a `Warning` event from kubelet with `FailedMount` as the reason.

**Explanation**

A persistent volume fails to connect to the Kubernetes cluster worker VM.

**Diagnostics**

* In your cloud provider console, verify that volumes are being created and attached to nodes.
* From the Kubernetes cluster master node, check the controller manager logs for errors attaching persistent volumes.
* From the Kubernetes cluster worker node, check kubelet for errors attaching persistent volumes.
