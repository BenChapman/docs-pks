## <a id="v0.8"></a>v0.8

**Release Date**: December 22, 2017

PKS (Pivotal Container Service) is used to create and manage on-demand Kubernetes clusters via the PKS CLI.

### Features

* Create, resize, delete, list, and show clusters through the PKS CLI
* Native support for NSX-T and Flannel
* Easily obtain kubeconfigs to use each cluster
* Use kubectl to view the Kubernetes dashboard
* Define a set plan that pre-configures VM size, authentication (RBAC or ABAC), and the number of workers for others to use when creating Kubernetes clusters

### Known Issues

* PKS v0.8 does not support air-gapped environments. This issue will be resolved for PKS v1.0. 
* PKS v0.8 with NSX-T integration does not support inserting external SSL certificates to trust NSX-T Manager. You must select **Disable SSL certificate verification**. This issue will be resolved for PKS v1.0.
* Operators who use the NSX-T integration can only assign 40 characters to a podâ€™s namespace.
* The `pks resize` command may roll additional VMs in the cluster, affecting workloads if the worker nodes are at capacity.
* Updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of each VM in each cluster. Also, updating other tiles in your deployment with new stemcells causes the rolling of the PKS tile. This is enabled by the **Upgrade all clusters errand**. Pivotal recommends that this errand remains on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. This automatic rolling could cause downtime in your deployment.
