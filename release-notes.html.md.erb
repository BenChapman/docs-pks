### <a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

This section includes known issues with PKS v1.1.0 RC and corresponding workarounds.

* The PKS v1.1.0 RC is only compatible with stemcell v3541.25. The latest stemcells available on Pivotal Network do not work with this RC release.
* The PKS v1.1.0 RC is not compliant with Kubernetes 1.10 on NSX-T.
* The version of NSX-T multi-master support included in this release has a limit on 2 clusters.

#### <a id="target-lb"></a>Reconfigure GCP Load Balancers After Master VM Recreation

If Kubernetes master node VMs are recreated for any reason, you must reconfigure your cluster load balancers to point to the new master VMs.
For example, after a stemcell upgrade, BOSH recreates the VMs in your deployment.

To locate the master VM IDs, do the following:

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>
1. To locate your cluster ID, run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME`. Your cluster ID appears in the **UUID** row.
1. Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into the Ops Manager VM, and use the BOSH CLI to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops Manager VM.
For more information, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).
1. Identify the name of your cluster deployment. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
  Your cluster deployment name begins with `service-instance` and includes a UUID.
1. Identify the master VM IDs by listing the VMs in your cluster. For example:
   <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d service-instance-aa1234567bc8de9f0a1c vms</pre>
   Your master VM IDs appears in the **VM CID** column.
1. From the GCP console, select the new master VM IDs from the load balancer backend dropdown.

For more information about cluster load balancers in GCP, see [Configuring a GCP Load Balancer for PKS Clusters](gcp-cluster-load-balancer.html).

#### <a id="upgrading-abac"></a>Upgrading ABAC Clusters

ABAC is no longer supported in v1.1. All existing ABAC clusters will be migrated to RBAC. When upgrading these clusters, kube-system pods will experience a small period of downtime. Additionally, any workloads using service accounts in ABAC will stop working after the upgrade. To fix these workloads, they must use RBAC.
