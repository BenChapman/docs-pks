### <a id="features"></a>Features

* Create, resize, delete, list, and show clusters through the PKS CLI
* Native support for NSX-T and Flannel
* Easily obtain kubeconfigs to use each cluster
* Use kubectl to view the Kubernetes dashboard
* Define plans that pre-configure VM size, authentication, default number of workers, and addons when creating Kubernetes clusters
* User/Admin configurations for access to PKS API
* Centralized logging through syslog

### <a id="known"></a>Known Issues

#### <a id="special"></a>Special Characters
In PKS v1.0.0, special characters, such as `#`, `&`, `;`, `"`, `'`, `^`, `\`, space (` `), `!`, and `%`  cannot be used in vCenter passwords.
PKS v1.0.1 adds support for the special characters listed above except for `!`.

#### Stemcell Incompatibility

When deploying the PKS v1.0.0 using NSX-T as the networking layer with a stemcell other than x3468.21, Kubernetes cluster deployments fail.
PKS v1.0.1 adds support for stemcells v3468.25 and later.

#### Stemcell Updates Cause Automatic VM Rolling

Enabling the **Upgrade all clusters** errand allows automatic rolling for VMs in your deployment.
Pivotal recommends enabling this errand to ensure that all deployed cluster VMs are patched.

When you enable the **Upgrade all clusters** errand, the following actions can cause downtime:

* Updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of each VM in each cluster.
* Updating other tiles in your deployment with new stemcells causes the rolling of the PKS tile.


#### Upgrade Errand Fails with Failed Deployments
The **Upgrade all clusters** errand fails if any deployments are in a failed state.

To work around this issue, [delete the failed cluster](delete-cluster.html) using the PKS CLI or [redeploy the failed cluster](manage-deployments-bosh.html) with the BOSH CLI to ensure the cluster is in a successful state.

#### Syslog Security Recommendations

BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that should be considered privileged.
For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials in PKS v1.0.0.
If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, using TLS encryption is strongly recommended to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.
