### <a id="known"></a>Known Issues

#### Stemcell Updates Cause Automatic VM Rolling
Enabling the **Upgrade all clusters** errand allows automatic rolling for VMs in your deployment.
Pivotal recommends enabling this errand to ensure that all deployed cluster VMs are patched.

When you enable the **Upgrade all clusters** errand, the following actions can cause downtime:

* Updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of each VM in each cluster.
* Updating other tiles in your deployment with new stemcells causes the rolling of the PKS tile.


#### Upgrade Errand Fails with Failed Deployments
The **Upgrade all clusters** errand fails if any deployments are in a failed state.

To work around this issue, [delete the failed cluster](using.html#delete-cluster) using the PKS CLI or [redeploy the failed cluster](managing.html#ssh) with the BOSH CLI to ensure the cluster is in a successful state.
