## <a id="v0.8"></a>v0.8

**Release Date**: December 22, 2017

PKS (Pivotal Container Service) is used to create and manage on-demand Kubernetes clusters via the PKS CLI.

### Features

* Create, resize, delete, list, and show clusters through the PKS CLI
* Native support for NSX-T and Flannel
* Easily obtain kubeconfigs to use each cluster
* Use kubectl to view the Kubernetes dashboard
* Define a set plan that pre-configures VM size, authentication (RBAC or ABAC), and the number of workers for others to use when creating Kubernetes clusters

### Known Issues

* PKS v0.8 does not support air-gapped environments. This issue will be resolved for PKS v1.0. 
* PKS v0.8 with NSX-T integration does not support inserting external SSL certificates to trust NSX-T Manager. You must select **Disable SSL certificate verification**. This issue will be resolved for PKS v1.0.
* Operators who use the NSX-T integration can only assign 40 characters to a podâ€™s namespace.
* The `pks resize` command may roll additional VMs in the cluster, affecting workloads if the worker nodes are at capacity.
* Master nodes don't have persistent disk attached. Perform following steps for workaround - This will not affect existing clusters and will need to be re-run after each 'Apply Changes'
  1. Create a file called `add_persistent_disk.yml` with the contents below:
     ```
     - type: replace
       path: /instance_groups/name=pivotal-container-service/properties/service_catalog/plans/name=default/instance_groups/name=master/persistent_disk_type?
       value: 5120
     ```
  1. Obtain the Ops Manager BOSH credentials.
  1. Log in to BOSH. 
  1. Obtain the pivotal-container-service deployment name running the `bosh deployments` command.
  1. Run the following commands:
     ```
     bosh -d <DEPLOYMENT-NAME> manifest > manifest.yml
     bosh -d <DEPLOYMENT-NAME> deploy manifest.yml --ops-file add_persistent_disk.yml
     ```
