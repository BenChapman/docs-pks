This topic describes how to manage users with User Account and Authentication (UAA) in Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

## <a id='uaac'></a>How to Use UAAC

Use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC) to interact with the UAA server.
You can either run UAAC commands from the Ops Manager VM or install UAAC on your local workstation.

To run UAAC commands from the Ops Manager VM, see the following SSH procedures for [vSphere](#ssh-vsphere) or [GCP](#ssh-gcp).

To install UAAC locally, see [Component: User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/concepts/architecture/uaa.html).

### <a id='ssh-vsphere'></a>SSH into the Ops Manager VM on vSphere

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM on vSphere, you need the credentials used to import the PCF .ova or .ovf file into your virtualization system.
You set these credentials when you installed Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you lose your credentials, you must shut down the Ops Manager VM in the vSphere UI and reset the password. See the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-E05E8AF9-C8F2-4482-B3F0-733C85C6DD97.html">vSphere documentation</a> for more information.</p>

1. From a command line, run `ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` to SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
Replace `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` with the fully qualified domain name of Ops Manager.

1. When prompted, enter the password that you set during the .ova deployment
into vCenter. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ ssh ubuntu&#64;my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com
  Password: ***********
  </pre>

1. Proceed to the [Retrieve UAA Admin Credentials](#uaa-admin) section to manage users with UAAC.

### <a id='ssh-gcp'></a>SSH into the Ops Manager VM on GCP

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM in GCP, follow these instructions:

1. Confirm that you have installed the gcloud CLI. See the [Google Cloud Platform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/#downloading_gcloud) for more information.

1. From the GCP console, click **Compute Engine**.

1. Locate the Ops Manager VM in the **VM Instances** list.

1. Click the **SSH** menu button.

1. Copy the SSH command that appears in the popup window.

1. Paste the command into your terminal window to SSH to the Ops Manager VM. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ gcloud compute ssh om-pcf-1a --zone us-central1-b
    </pre>

1. Run `sudo su - ubuntu` to switch to the `ubuntu` user.

1. Proceed to the [Retrieve UAA Admin Credentials](#uaa-admin) section to manage users with UAAC.

##<a id='uaa-admin'></a> Retrieve UAA Admin Credentials

To retrieve the UAA admin client secret, do the following:

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager and click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.
1. Click **Credentials**.
1. To view the UAA admin client password, click **Uaa Admin Secret**. The client username is `admin`.

You can use these credentials to log in to UAAC and create UAA user accounts.

##<a id='uaa-scopes'></a> Grant Cluster Access to a User

To allow a user to access clusters in PKS, do the following using UAAC:

1. Target your UAA server using `uaac target https://UAA-URL:8443`.
Replace `UAA-URL` with the domain name you configured in the **UAA** pane of the PKS tile.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ uaac target https&#58;//api.pks.example.com:8443</pre>

1. Authenticate with UAA using the secret you retrieved in the previous section.
Run the following command, replacing `UAA-ADMIN-SECRET` with your UAA admin secret: <pre>uaac token client get admin -s UAA-ADMIN-SECRET</pre>

1. (Optional) Create a user by running `uaac user add USERNAME --emails USER-EMAIL -p USER-PASSWORD`. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ uaac user add alana --emails alana&#64;example.com -p password</pre>
  See [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI (UAAC)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/uaa/uaa-user-management.html) for more information.

1. Assign a scope to a user to allow them to access Kubernetes clusters.
Run `uaac member add UAA-SCOPE USERNAME`, replacing `UAA-SCOPE` with one of the following UAA scopes:
  * `pks.clusters.admin`: Users with this scope have full access to all clusters.
  * `pks.clusters.manage`: Users with this scope can only access clusters they create.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ uaac member add pks.clusters.admin alana</pre>
