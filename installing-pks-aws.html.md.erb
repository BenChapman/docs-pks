1. Select the availability zone (AZ) where you want to deploy the PKS API VM as a singleton job.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must select an additional AZ for balancing other jobs before clicking <strong>Save</strong>, but this selection has no effect in the current version of PKS.</p>

    ![Assign AZs and Networks pane in Ops Manager](images/azs-networks.png)

1. Under **Network**, select the infrastructure subnet you created for the PKS API VM.
1. Under **Service Network**, select the services subnet you created for Kubernetes cluster VMs.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='pks-api'></a> PKS API

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **PKS API**.
1. Under **Certificate to secure the PKS API**, provide your own wildcard certificate and private key pair.
The certificate you enter here should cover the domain that routes to the PKS broker VM with TLS termination on the ingress.<br><br>
    (Optional) If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can have Ops Manager generate one for you. Perform the following steps:
  1. Select the **Generate RSA Certificate** link.
  1. Enter the wildcard domain for your API hostname.
    For example, if your PKS API domain is `api.pks.example.com`, then enter `*.pks.example.com`.
  1. Click **Generate**.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='plans'></a> Plans

To activate a plan, do the following:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A plan defines a set of resource types used for deploying clusters. You can configure up to three plans. Configuring **Plan 1** is required.
  </p>
1. Select **Active** to activate the plan and make it available to developers deploying clusters.
1. Under **Name**, provide a unique name for the plan.
1. Under **Description**, edit the description as needed.
The plan description appears in the Services Marketplace, which developers can access by using PKS CLI.
1. Under **AZ placement**, select an AZ for the Kubernetes clusters deployed by PKS.
1. Under **Default Cluster Authorization Mode**, select an authentication mode for the Kubernetes clusters. Pivotal recommends selecting **RBAC**. For more information, see the [RBAC Support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/04/rbac-support-in-kubernetes) blog post.
1. Under **ETCD/Master VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes etcd and master nodes.
1. Under **Master Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes master VM.
1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Node Instances**, select the default number of Kubernetes worker nodes to provision for each cluster. For high availability, Pivotal recommends creating clusters with at least 3 worker nodes.
1. Under **Errand VM Type**, select the size of the VM where the errand will run. The smallest instance possible is sufficient, as the only errand running on this VM is the one that applies the **Default Cluster App** YAML configuration.
1. (Optional) Under **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution**, enter additional YAML configuration to [add custom workloads](custom-workloads.html) to each cluster in this plan. You can specify multiple files using `---` as a separator.
1. If you want users to be able to create [pods with privileged containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#privileged-mode-for-pod-containers), select the **Enable Privileged Containers - Use with caution** option.
1. Click **Save**.

To deactivate a plan, do the following:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
1. Select **Plan Inactive**.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

To configure your Kubernetes cloud provider settings, do the following:

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.
1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select **AWS**.
1. Perform the steps specific to AWS.
  * Enter your **AWS Master Access Key ID** and **Master Secret Access Key**. See [Preparing to Deploy PKS to AWS](aws-prepare-env.html#create-master) for more information.
  * Enter your **AWS Worker Access Key ID** and **Worker Secret Access Key**. See [Preparing to Deploy PKS to AWS](aws-prepare-env.html#create-worker) for more information.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Network**, select **Flannel**.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='uaa'></a> UAA

To configure the UAA server, do the following:

1. Click **UAA**.
1. Under **UAA URL**, enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to access UAA on the PKS broker VM. This URL must belong to the domain you provided in the [PKS API](#pks-api) section.
For example, if you provided a certificate for `*.pks.example.com`, enter `api.pks.example.com` for the UAA URL.
1. Under **PKS CLI Access Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI access token lifetime.
1. Under **PKS CLI Refresh Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI refresh token lifetime.

###<a id='syslog'></a> (Optional) Syslog

You can designate an external syslog endpoint for PKS component and cluster log messages.

To specify the destination for PKS log messages, do the following:

1. Click **Syslog**.
1. Select **Yes** to configure syslog forwarding.
1. Enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Enter the destination syslog port.
1. Select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. (Optional) Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption when forwarding logs as they may contain sensitive information. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. To enable TLS, perform the following steps.
  1. Provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.</p>

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation. 

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand. For a typical PKS deployment, Pivotal recommends that you leave the default settings.

For more information about errands and their configuration state, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

1. To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **PKS on-demand broker** job.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Consider increasing the available resources for the on-demand broker job if you are experiencing slowness or timeouts with when interacting with the PKS API.</p>

1. Enter a name for your PKS API load balancer that begins with `tcp:` in the **Load Balancers** column.
For example, `tcp:pks-api`.
For more information, see [Step 1: Configure External Load Balancer](#loadbalancer-pks-api).

###<a id='stemcell'></a> (Optional) Stemcell

To edit the stemcell configuration, click **Stemcell**. Click **Import Stemcell** to import a new stemcell. 

PKS uses floating stemcells. Floating stemcells allow upgrades to the minor versions of stemcells but not the major versions. 
For example, a stemcell can float from `1234.56` to `1234.99` but not from `1234.991` to `1235.0`. 
For more information on floating stemcells, see the 
[Understanding Floating Stemcells](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html) topic.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <b>Upgrade all clusters errand</b>. Pivotal recommends that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.</p>

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 4: Apply Changes

After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint

You must share the PKS API endpoint to allow your organization to use the API to create, update, and delete clusters.
See [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.html) for more information.

To retrieve the PKS API endpoint, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click the Pivotal Container Service tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab and locate the **Pivotal Container Service** job. The IP address of the Pivotal Container Service job is the PKS API endpoint.

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps

Configure authentication for PKS using either User Account and Authentication (UAA) or enterprise single sign-on (SSO).

To create and manage users using UAA, see [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html).

To set up SSO configuration with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), see [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](configure-sso.html).

After configuring authentication, follow the procedures in [Configure PKS API Access](configure-api.html) to enable operators to create and manage clusters.
