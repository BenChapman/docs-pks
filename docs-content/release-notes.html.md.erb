## v0.5.0-1 (Dev Release)

**Release Date**: Nov 13, 2017

This is the first release of the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) tile. The tile contains [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://docs-kubo.cfapps.io) (CFCR), an [On-Demand Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/), a Service Adapter, and the PKS API. 

This product can be installed independently of the Pivotal Application Service/Elastic Runtime tile and the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). The release allows users to interface directly with the PKS API to create Kubernetes clusters on vSphere.

### Features

* The PKS tile is accessible on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) for internal and alpha users.
* Users can use Ops Manager to deploy the tile. See [Installing and Configuring PKS](installing.html) for more information.
* Proxy routing mode enables PKS and `kubo-odb` to be deployed on vSphere with an option for HAProxy routing. 
* Users can create a second Kubernetes cluster on vSphere using the On-Demand Broker. This version includes a workaround to pass the `kubernetes_master_host` and `worker_haproxy_ip_addresses` via the cloud config, to be able to create a cluster without conflicting with IPs that are already used.
* Processes on the broker VM are running as `vcap`. The only process running as `root` is the `bosh-dns-nameserverconfig`, a BOSH job for DNS.
* Cloud Foundry configuration is not required to deploy the On-Demand Broker, as long as startup checks are disabled. PKS will work without a configured Cloud Foundry.
* Users can created, delete, and bind to on-demand service instances without Cloud Foundry configured.
* CFCR 0.8.0 is now available. CFCR was formerly known as Kubo.

### Alpha Features 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Because these are alpha features, they may contain bugs.</p>

* Cluster data in the PKS API will persist after restarting PKS.
* Workloads with persistence can be deployed on clusters created with PKS on vSphere.
* Users can delete clusters using the PKS API.
* When listing clusters, the PKS API will display clusters while they are deleting.
* The PKS tile configuration allows users to define the default cluster configuration that is deployed with the PKS API.
* The PKS tile configuration allows users to select a default cluster authorization mode, instead of only deploying clusters with ABAC mode enabled.

## Bug Fixes

* The `worker_node_tag` is no longer required for users to set, and will be inserted into the manifest directly by deployment scripts.

## Known Issues

* The PKS tile is only installable on vSphere. GCP support is coming in the next few releases.
* Ops Manager uses a default runtime config that disables `override_nameserver` for BOSH DNS. You must set this property to `true` in order to enable the CFCR (Kubo) workers to communicate with the CFCR (Kubo) master. To set `override_nameserver` to `true`, perform the following steps:<br><br>
      1. Perform the procedures in [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html) to gather your credential and IP address information for the BOSH Director, SSH into the Ops Manager VM, and log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops Manager VM.  
      1. On the Ops Manager VM, enter the following command to set the `runtime_config` variable:
      <pre class="terminal">$ runtime\_config=$(bosh2 runtime-config --name ops_manager\_dns\_runtime)</pre>
      1. Use the BOSH CLI v2 to update the runtime config. Enter the following command:
      <pre class="terminal">$ bosh2 --non-interactive update-runtime-config --name ops\_manager\_dns_runtime \
      <(echo "$runtime\_config" | sed /override\_nameserver/s/false/true/)</pre>

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The `override_nameserver` property is reset whenever you click **Apply Changes**, setting the configuration back to `false`.</p>
