By default, the resize command prompts for interactive confirmation.

```
pks resize <cluster-name> [flags]
```

```
  pks resize my-cluster --num-nodes 5
```

      --non-interactive   Don't ask for user input
  -n, --num-nodes int32   Number of worker nodes (default 1)
      --wait              Wait for the operation to finish
