  On the command line, run the following command to log in:
    <pre>
    pks login -a PKS&#95;API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --ca-cert CERT-PATH
    </pre>
  Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:
  * `PKS\_API` is the domain name you entered in **Ops Manager** > **Pivotal Container Service** > **UAA** > **UAA URL**. For example, `https\://api.pks.example.com`.
  * `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` belong to the account you created in the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ step in the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.
  * `CERT-PATH` is the path to your root CA certificate. Provide the certificate to validate the PKS API certificate with SSL. If you are logging in to a trusted environment, you can use `-k` to skip SSL verification instead of `--ca-cert CERT-PATH`.
