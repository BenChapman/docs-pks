This topic describes how to back up and restore the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) control plane.
PKS uses the Cloud Foundry [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html) framework to back up and restore PKS deployments.

The PKS control plane includes the following components:

* UAA MySQL database
* PKS API MySQL database

BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the PKS control plane components.
BBR does not back up cluster data or deployed applications.
