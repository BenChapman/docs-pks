Follow the steps below to view the list of deployed Kubernetes cluster with the PKS CLI.

1. On the command line, run the following command to log in:
  <pre>
  pks login -a PKS_API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
  </pre>
  Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:
  * `PKS_API` is your PKS API hostname. For example, `pks.example.com`. The PKS CLI uses port 9021 by default.
  * `USERNAME` is your PKS API username. The `USERNAME` is the user created as a result of the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ step in the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.
  * `PASSWORD` is your PKS API password. The `PASSWORD` can be retrieved by following the steps detailed in the _Retrieve UAA Admin Credentials_ section of the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-admin) topic.
