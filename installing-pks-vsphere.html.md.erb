Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Select the availability zone (AZ) where you want to deploy the PKS API VM as a singleton job.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must select an additional AZ for balancing other jobs before clicking <strong>Save</strong>, but this selection has no effect in the current version of PKS.</p>

    ![Assign AZs and Networks pane in Ops Manager](images/azs-networks.png)

1. Under **Network**, select the infrastructure subnet you created for the PKS API VM.
1. Under **Service Network**, select the services subnet you created for Kubernetes cluster VMs.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='pks-api'></a> PKS API

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **PKS API**.
1. Under **Certificate to secure the PKS API**, provide your own wildcard certificate and private key pair.
The certificate you enter here should cover the domain that routes to the PKS broker VM with TLS termination on the ingress.<br><br>
    (Optional) If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can have Ops Manager generate one for you. Perform the following steps:
  1. Select the **Generate RSA Certificate** link.
  1. Enter the wildcard domain for your API hostname.
    For example, if your PKS API domain is `api.pks.example.com`, then enter `*.pks.example.com`.
  1. Click **Generate**.
1. Under **API Hostname (FQDN)**, enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to access the PKS API.
For example, `api.pks.example.com`.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='plans'></a> Plans

To activate a plan, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A plan defines a set of resource types used for deploying clusters. You can configure up to three plans. Configuring **Plan 1** is required.
  </p>
1. Select **Active** to activate the plan and make it available to developers deploying clusters.
1. Under **Name**, provide a unique name for the plan.
1. Under **Description**, edit the description as needed.
The plan description appears in the Services Marketplace, which developers can access by using PKS CLI.
1. Under **AZ placement**, select an AZ for the Kubernetes clusters deployed by PKS.
1. Under **Default Cluster Authorization Mode**, select an authentication mode for the Kubernetes clusters. Pivotal recommends selecting **RBAC**. For more information, see the [RBAC Support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/04/rbac-support-in-kubernetes) blog post.
1. Under **ETCD/Master VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes etcd and master nodes.
1. Under **Master Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes master VM.
1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Node Instances**, select the default number of Kubernetes worker nodes to provision for each cluster. For high availability, Pivotal recommends creating clusters with at least 3 worker nodes.
1. Under **Errand VM Type**, select the size of the VM where the errand will run. The smallest instance possible is sufficient, as the only errand running on this VM is the one that applies the **Default Cluster App** YAML configuration.
1. (Optional) Under **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution**, enter additional YAML configuration to [add custom workloads](custom-workloads.html) to each cluster in this plan. You can specify multiple files using `---` as a separator.
1. If you want users to be able to create [pods with privileged containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#privileged-mode-for-pod-containers), select the **Enable Privileged Containers - Use with caution** option.
1. Click **Save**.

To deactivate a plan, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
1. Select **Plan Inactive**.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.
1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select vSphere.
1. Perform the steps specific to vSphere. Ensure the values match those in the **vCenter Config** section of the **Ops Manager** tile:  
  1. Enter your **vCenter Master Credentials**. See [Preparing to Deploy PKS on vSphere](vsphere-prepare-env.html#create-master) for more information.
  1. Enter your **vCenter Worker Credentials**. See [Preparing to Deploy PKS on vSphere](vsphere-prepare-env.html#create-worker) for more information.
  1. Enter your **vCenter Host**. For example: `vcenter.CF-EXAMPLE.com`.
  1. Enter your **Datacenter Name**. For example: `CF-EXAMPLE-dc`.
  1. Enter your **Datastore Name**. For example: `CF-EXAMPLE-ds`.
  1. Enter the **Stored VM Folder** so that the persistent stores know where to find the VMs. To retrieve the name of the folder, navigate to your Ops Manager Director tile, click **vCenter Config**, and locate the value for **VM Folder**. The default folder name is `pcf_vms`.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. (Optional) Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled** to configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters.
  ![Enable HTTP/HTTPS Proxy configuration](images/https-proxy.png)
  1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.
  1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password in either **HTTP Proxy Credentials** or **HTTPS Proxy Credentials**.
  1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the `.internal`, `10.100.0.0/8`, and `10.200.0.0/8` IP ranges are not proxied. This is to allow internal PKS communication.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='uaa'></a> UAA

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **UAA**.
1. Under **PKS CLI Access Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI access token lifetime.
1. Under **PKS CLI Refresh Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI refresh token lifetime.

###<a id='syslog'></a> (Optional) Syslog

You can designate an external syslog endpoint for PKS component and cluster log messages.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that should be considered privileged.
For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials.
If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, using TLS encryption is strongly recommended to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.</p>

To specify the destination for PKS log messages, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Syslog**.
1. Select **Yes** to configure syslog forwarding.
1. Enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Enter the destination syslog port.
1. Select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. Optional: Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption when forwarding logs as they may contain sensitive information. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. To enable TLS, perform the following steps.
  1. Provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.</p>

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation. 

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand. For a typical PKS deployment, Pivotal recommends that you leave the default settings.

For more information about errands and their configuration state, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).

###<a id='resource-config'></a> (Optional) Resource Config

To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **PKS on-demand broker** job.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Consider increasing the available resources for the on-demand broker job if you are experiencing slowness or timeouts with when interacting with the PKS API.</p>

If you created a PKS API load balancer, enter a name that begins with `tcp:` in the **Load Balancers** column. For example, `tcp:pks-api`.

###<a id='stemcell'></a> (Optional) Stemcell

To edit the stemcell configuration, click **Stemcell**. Click **Import Stemcell** to import a new stemcell. 

PKS uses floating stemcells. Floating stemcells allow upgrades to the minor versions of stemcells but not the major versions. 
For example, a stemcell can float from `1234.56` to `1234.99` but not from `1234.991` to `1235.0`. 

For more information on floating stemcells, see the 
[Understanding Floating Stemcells](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html) topic.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <b>Upgrade all clusters errand</b>. Pivotal recommends that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.</p>

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 3: Apply Changes

After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 4: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint

You must share the PKS API endpoint to allow your organization to use the API to create, update, and delete clusters.
See [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.html) for more information.

Perform the following steps to retrieve the PKS API endpoint:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click the Pivotal Container Service tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab and locate the **Pivotal Container Service** job. The IP address of the Pivotal Container Service job is the PKS API endpoint.

##<a id='loadbalancer-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Configure External Load Balancer

Configure an external load balancer to access the PKS API from outside the network.
You can use any external load balancer of your choice.

Your external load balancer forwards traffic to the PKS API endpoint on ports 9021 and 8443.
Configure the external load balancer to resolve to the domain name you set in the [PKS API](#pks-api) section of the tile configuration.

The load balancer should be configured with:

- The IP address from [Step 4: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint](installing-pks-vsphere.html#retrieve-pks-api)
- Ports 8443 and 9021
- The HTTPS or TCP protocol

After you configure your external load balancer, return to the [Resource Config](#resource-config) tab in the PKS tile to give your load balancer a name.

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps

Configure authentication for PKS using either User Account and Authentication (UAA) or enterprise single sign-on (SSO).

To create and manage users using UAA, see [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html).

To set up SSO configuration with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), see [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](configure-sso.html).

After configuring authentication, follow the procedures in [Configure PKS API Access](configure-api.html) to enable operators to create and manage clusters.
