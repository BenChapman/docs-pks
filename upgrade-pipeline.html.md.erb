This topic describes how to setup a concourse pipeline to perform upgrade of a PKS installation.

When a new PKS release becomes available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) this pipeline will automatically upgrade your installation.

The pipeline can be downloaded from: [https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-automation/](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-automation/)

The documentation can be found at: [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/tree/v0.23.0/upgrade-tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/tree/v0.23.0/upgrade-tile)

**NOTE:** By default the pipeline will only upgrade when a new patch version is available.

This can be configured to follow minor version updates, using a regular expression: [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/blob/v0.23.0/upgrade-tile/params.yml#L22](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/blob/v0.23.0/upgrade-tile/params.yml#L22)
