This topic describes how to setup a concourse pipeline to perform upgrade of a PKS installation.

When a new PKS release becomes available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) this pipeline will automatically upgrade your installation.

The pipeline can be downloaded from: [https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-automation/](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-automation/)
