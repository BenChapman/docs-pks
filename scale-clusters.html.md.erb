title: Scale Existing Clusters
owner: PKS
---

Follow the steps below to scale up an existing cluster using the PKS CLI.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot scale the number of worker nodes down. You can only scale the number of worker nodes up.</p>

1. On the command line, run the following command to log in:
  <pre>
  pks login -a PKS_API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
  </pre>
  * `PKS_API` is your PKS API hostname. For example, `pks.example.com`. The PKS CLI uses port 9021 by default.
  * `USERNAME` is your PKS API username. The `USERNAME` is the user created as a result of the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ step in the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.
  * `PASSWORD` is your PKS API password. The `PASSWORD` can be retrieved by following the steps detailed in the _Retrieve UAA Admin Credentials_ section of the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-admin) topic.
1. Run the following command below to scale up your cluster. You cannot scale the number of worker nodes down.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This command may roll additional VMs in the cluster, affecting workloads if the worker nodes are at capacity. This issue will be resolved in a future release of PKS.</p>
  <pre>
  pks resize CLUSTER-NAME --num-nodes WORKER-NODES
  </pre>
  Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:
  * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
  * `WORKER-NODES` is the number of worker nodes for the cluster. The maximum number of worker nodes is 50.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks resize my-cluster --num-nodes 5</pre>
