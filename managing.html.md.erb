After installing PKS, operators can give developers the ability to create and manage Kubernetes clusters with the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI).

##<a id='access-logs'></a> Access Cluster Logs

To access cluster logs, perform the following steps:

1. Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into the Ops Manager VM, and use the BOSH CLI v2 to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops Manager VM. For more information, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI
](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).
1. After logging in to the BOSH Director, identify the names of the VMs you want to retrieve logs from by listing all VMs in your deployment. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh2 -e my-env -d my-dep vms</pre> 
1. Download the logs from the VM. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh2 -e my-env -d my-dep logs pks/0</pre>
	See the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/job-logs.html) for more information.
