This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Container Service (PKS) vSphere without NSX-T integration.

Before performing the procedures in this topic, consult the requirements in the [Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](requirements.html) topic.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 1: Install PKS

Perform the following steps to install PKS:

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
1. Navigate to `https://YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/` in a browser to log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. From the **Director Config** page, configure the following settings:
  * Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts**.
  * Clear the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox.
1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.
1. Under **Pivotal Container Service** in the left column, click the plus sign to add this product to your staging area.

##<a id='configure'></a> Step 2: Configure PKS

Click the orange **Pivotal Container Service** tile to start the configuration process.

###<a id='azs-networks'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an availability zone for your singleton jobs, and one or more availability zones to balance other jobs in.
This is where PCF creates the PKS broker.
1. Under **Network**, select a subnet for the PKS broker.
1. Under **Service Network**, select a subnet for the on-demand service instances created by the PKS broker.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='pks-api'></a> PKS API

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **PKS API**.
1. Under **Certificate**, provide your own certificate or have Ops Manager generate one. To generate a new certificate and key, enter a wildcard domain you own. For example, `*.pks.pcfvsphere.mydomain.com`.
1. Under **Generate RSA Certificate**, provide the domain names that you want your certificate to have. The domain names should contain 
the hostname you intend to use for accessing the PKS API service. 
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='plan'></a> Plan

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Plan**.
1. Under **Plan description**, edit the description as needed. The plan description appears in the Services Marketplace, which developers can access by using either the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) or Apps Manager. 
1. Under **Default Cluster Authorization Mode**, select an authentication mode for the Kubernetes clusters.
1. Under **AZ placement**, select an availability zone for the Kubernetes clusters deployed by PKS.
1. Under **ETCD VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for the Kubernetes etcd nodes. 
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This configuration is temporary until the master and etcd nodes are merged.</p>
1. Under **Master VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes master nodes.
1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes worker nodes.
1. Under **Worker Instances**, select the default number of Kubernetes worker nodes to provision for each cluster.
1. (Optional) Under **Default Cluster Apps**, enter additional YAML configuration to [add custom workloads](managing.html#custom-workloads) to each cluster in this plan.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='kubernetes-cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.
1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select your IaaS.
1. Perform the steps specific to your IaaS.
	* For **vSphere**, ensure the values match those in the **vCenter Config** section of the **Ops Manager** tile:
		1. Enter your **vCenter Host**, such as `vcenter.cf-example.com`.
		1. Enter your **Datacenter Name**, such as `cf-example-dc`.
		1. Enter your **Datastore Name**, such as `cf-example-ds`.
		1. Enter the **Stored VM Folder** so that the persistent stores know where to find the VMs. To retrieve the name of the folder, navigate to your Ops Manager Director tile, click **vCenter Config**, and locate the value for **VM Folder**. The default folder name is `pcf_vms`.
	* For **GCP**, ensure the values match those in the **Google Config** section of the **Ops Manager** tile:
		1. Enter your **GCP Project Id**.
		1. Enter your **GCP Service Key**, which you created using [the instructions from the GCP prerequisites](requirements.html#gcp-prereqs).
		1. Enter your **VPC Network**, which is the VPC network name for your Ops Manager environment.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Network**, select the Container Network Interface to use.
	* For **Flannel**, no additional fields are required.
	* For **NSX-T**, see [Installing and Configuring PKS with NSX-T Integration](installing-nsx-t.html).
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='resource-config'></a> (Optional) Resource Config

To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **PKS on-demand broker** job.

###<a id='stemcell'></a> (Optional) Stemcell

To edit the stemcell configuration, click **Stemcell**. Click **Import Stemcell** to import a new stemcell. 

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 3: Apply Changes

After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 4: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint

You must share the PKS API endpoint to allow your organization to use the API to create, update, and delete clusters.

When an operator creates a cluster, they provide an IP address for the Kubernetes master host, then point the load balancer to the newly created cluster.
If you use a load balancer as a service (LBaaS) tool, your LBaaS may manage cluster creation and configuration.

See [Using PKS](using.html#create-cluster) for more information.

Perform the following steps to retrieve the PKS API endpoint:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click the PKS tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab and locate the IP address of the PKS API endpoint. This is the endpoint that developers use to create and manage clusters.

##<a id='loadbalancer-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Configure External Load Balancer

Configure your external load balancer to resolve to the domain name used in the certificate you provided during the [PKS API](#pks-api) section of the tile configuration. Your external load balancer will forward traffic to the PKS API endpoint.

##<a id='troubleshooting'></a> Troubleshooting Installation

This section describes the symptoms of common installation errors and provides troubleshooting procedures.

###<a id='missing-addons'></a>Missing Add-ons

If your provisioned cluster is missing system add-ons, such as `kube-dns`, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.
1. Click the Ops Manager v2.0 tile.
1. Select **Director Config**.
1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This setting enables post-deploy scripts for all tiles in your Ops Manager installation.</p>
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.
1. After Ops Manager finishes applying changes, delete the cluster using the `pks delete-cluster` command. See the _Delete Cluster_ section of the [Using PKS](using.html#delete-cluster) topic for more information.
1. Recreate the cluster using the `pks create-cluster` command. See the _Create Cluster_ section of the [Using PKS](using.html#create-cluster) topic for more information.
