<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The PKS documentation is under development. This topic will continue to be updated and expanded to reflect the most current information.</p>

This topic provides an overview of how to install Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

To install PKS, you must have a vSphere or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment with Ops Manager v2.0 deployed. If you are installing PKS on vSphere, you can also configure integration with NSX-T and Harbor. 

Consult the following table:

<table>
<tr>
<th>IaaS</th>
<th>Ops Manager v2.0</th>
<th>NSX-T</th>
<th>Harbor</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vSphere</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>Available</td>
<td>Available</td>
</tr>
<td>GCP</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>Not Available</td>
<td>Not Available</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have Pivotal Application Service (PAS) installed, Pivotal recommends installing PKS on a separate instance of Ops Manager v2.0. For information about the impact of BOSH DNS on PKS, see the <a href="requirements.html#ops-man">Ops Manager v2.0</a> section of the <em>Prerequisites and Resource Requirements</em> topic.</p>
