Follow the steps below to view the details of an individual cluster using the PKS CLI.

1. On the command line, run the following command to log in:
  <pre>
  pks login -a PKS_API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
  </pre>
  * `PKS_API` is your PKS API hostname. For example, `pks.example.com`. The PKS CLI uses port 9021 by default. `PKS_API` is the same URL configured in the **UAA URL** field. Refer to **Ops Manager** > **Pivotal Container Service** > **UAA** > **UAA URL** for the **UAA URL**.
  * `USERNAME` is your PKS API username. The `USERNAME` is the user created as a result of the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ step in the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.
  * `PASSWORD` is your PKS API password. The `PASSWORD` can be retrieved by following the steps detailed in the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ section of the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.

1. Run the following command to view the details of an individual cluster:
  <pre>
  pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
  </pre>
  Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks cluster my-cluster</pre>
