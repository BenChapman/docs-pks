title: Prerequisites for Using PKS
owner: PKS
---

The procedures for using PKS have the following prerequisites:

* You must have a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment with Ops Manager v2.0 or later and PKS installed.

* You must have the [PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html) installed.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: The PKS CLI is under active development and commands may change. To ensure you have installed the latest version, we recommend that you re-install the PKS CLI before you use it. To install the PKS CLI, see <a href="installing-pks-cli.html">Installing the PKS CLI</a>.</p>

* You must have `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI, installed. To download and install `kubectl`, see the [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl) topic in the Kubernetes documentation. For more information about using `kubectl`, see the [kubectl documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/).

* You must have an external TCP or HTTPS load balancer configured to forward traffic to the PKS API endpoint. For more information, see the Configure External Load Balancer section of <em>Installing and Configuring PKS on [GCP](installing-pks-gcp.html#loadbalancer-pks-api) or [vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#loadbalancer-pks-api)</em>.

* You must have your PKS API endpoint and your UAA credentials. To retrieve these values, perform the following steps:
  1. Navigate to the **Pivotal Container Service** tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
  1. Click **Credentials**.
  1. To retrieve the UAA credentials, click **Uaa Admin Secret**.
  1. Click the **Status** tab.
  1. Retrieve the PKS API IP under **IPs**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If your PKS installation is integrated with NSX-T, use the DNAT IP address assigned in the <a href="installing-nsx-t.html#apply-changes">Apply Changes and Retrieve the PKS Endpoint</a> section of <em>Installing and Configuring PKS with NSX-T Integration</em>.</p>
