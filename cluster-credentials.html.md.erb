title: Retrieve Cluster Credentials and Configuration
owner: PKS
---

Follow the steps below to retrieve the cluster credentials and configuration using the PKS CLI.

1. On the command line, run the following command to log in:
  <pre>
  pks login -a PKS_API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
  </pre>
  Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:
  * `PKS_API` is your PKS API hostname. For example, `pks.example.com`. The PKS CLI uses port 9021 by default.
  * `USERNAME` is your PKS API username. The `USERNAME` is the user created as a result of the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ step in the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.
  * `PASSWORD` is your PKS API password. The `PASSWORD` can be retrieved by following the steps detailed in the _Grant Cluster Access to a User_ section of the [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html#uaa-scopes) topic.

1. Run the following command to retrieve the cluster credentials and configuration:
  <pre>
  pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME
  </pre>
  Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks get-credentials my-cluster</pre>

You can use the `pks get-credentials` command to perform the following actions:

  - Fetch the cluster's `kubeconfig`
  - Add the cluster's `kubeconfig` to the existing `kubeconfig`
  - Create a new `kubeconfig`, if none exists
  - Switch the context to the `CLUSTER-NAME` provided

The `kubeconfig` file path works the same way as `kubectl`.
If you do not set the file path, the default path is `$HOME/.kube/config`.
Use the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to change the `kubeconfig` file path.

You can use the credentials and the `kubeconfig` to deploy application workloads to your cluster with `kubectl`. For more information about accessing your cluster, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/).
