title: Retrieve Cluster Credentials and Configuration
owner: PKS
---

Follow the steps below to retrieve the cluster credentials and configuration using the PKS CLI.

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>

1. Run the following command to retrieve the cluster credentials and configuration:
  <pre>
  pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME
  </pre>
  Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pks get-credentials my-cluster</pre>

You can use the `pks get-credentials` command to perform the following actions:

  - Fetch the cluster's `kubeconfig`
  - Add the cluster's `kubeconfig` to the existing `kubeconfig`
  - Create a new `kubeconfig`, if none exists
  - Switch the context to the `CLUSTER-NAME` provided

The `kubeconfig` file path works the same way as `kubectl`.
If you do not set the file path, the default path is `$HOME/.kube/config`.
Use the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to change the `kubeconfig` file path.
For example:
<pre class="terminal">$ KUBECONFIG=/path/to/my-cluster.config pks get-credentials my-cluster</pre>

You can use the credentials and the `kubeconfig` to deploy application workloads to your cluster with `kubectl`. For more information about accessing your cluster, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/).
